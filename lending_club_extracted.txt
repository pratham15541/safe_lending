For several years, the lending platform operated with steady confidence. 
Borrowers applied for loans by sharing details about their income, employment, credit 
history, and existing debts. The platform evaluated these details, assigned each loan a grade 
to reflect risk, and set an interest rate that was meant to balance borrower affordability with 
investor return. Investors funded the loans, repayments flowed back over time, and the 
system appeared to function as intended. 
Loan volumes increased between 2007 and 2015. Default rates stayed within expected 
ranges. Performance summaries suggested that the grading and pricing framework was 
working. 
On the surface, the marketplace seemed stable. 
Over time, however, small irregularities began to appear. 
Loans with the same grade did not always perform similarly across different states. 
Borrowers with comparable credit scores showed different repayment patterns depending 
on their debt levels or employment history. Some higher-income applicants defaulted 
unexpectedly, while some with moderate profiles repaid consistently. Joint applications did 
not behave in exactly the same way as individual ones, even when their combined financial 
indicators looked strong. 
None of these differences were large enough to trigger alarm on their own. There was no 
sudden rise in defaults, no dramatic breakdown in investor returns. But taken together, the 
variations raised a quiet concern. 
Were the signals used to judge risk still capturing borrower behavior accurately? Or had the 
meaning of some of these indicators shifted over time? If two borrowers look similar on 
paper, should they be expected to behave similarly in practice? If a loan is assigned a 
particular grade, does that grade still reflect the level of risk it once did? 
The platform’s leadership is not asking whether default exists. They know that lending 
always carries risk. 
They want to understand something more basic. 
Does the relationship between borrower characteristics, assigned grades, interest rates, and 
final loan outcomes remain consistent? Or are there patterns beneath the surface that 
suggest the system’s balance may not be as steady as it appears? 
You have been provided with historical loan records from the platform’s growth years, 
including borrower details, credit information, loan terms, grades, pricing, and repayment 
status. 
Within this data lies the answer to whether the marketplace’s stability reflects strength - or 
whether it conceals gradual drift. 
The system continues to operate. 
The question is whether it is operating as intended.
